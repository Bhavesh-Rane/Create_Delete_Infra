RG, Vnet, Subnet, NSG with inbound rule to whitelist sourceIP and VM
The launch & destroy action should be handled through commandline arguments

.\infra.ps1 -action destroy



Once the script is done push it to a remote github repo (create a personal github repo for practice) 
Implement a dockerfile with windows nanoserver as base image. The container should have following packages installed on it

Git Repo : https://github.com/Bhavesh-Rane/Create_Delete_Infra
1) git
2) azure powershell modules
